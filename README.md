# steam-login

Simple Steam account manager for linux.

## Why?

Using `steam-login <username>` instead of `steam` allows you to log in previously accessed accounts without having to retype password and/or Steam Guard code.

## Usage

- Install `steam-login`
- Launch `steam-login <username>` where `<username>` is replaced with your login username
- Enter your password and make sure `Remember Account` is **checked**
- To change account, launch `steam-login` and provide a different username

**Please Note:** Do not manually logout of account using steam, as this seems to erase all account history
